# Employee-Future-Prediction
The ability to solve real life situation by creating 
highly efficient and accurate model is the beauty of every 
machine learning project, the paper is a report of a research to 
create a model that predict whether an employee would leave 
work or not within two years, this is achieved by modelling past 
dataset gotten from Kaggle, the dataset was tuned to get the best 
result, major classification algorithms were performed, after 
which the dataset was oversampled to cater for biasness and the 
algorithms were performed again and compared, although all 
models performed well generally, the decision tree classifier and 
the adaptive boosting classifier performed best and showed to 
be the most efficient and accurate. The most important feature 
of a model is unbiasedness and this was majorly tackled in this 
research.
